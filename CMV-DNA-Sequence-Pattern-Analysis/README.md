# Data-Analysis
## Investigation For Unusual Clusters In The Palindromes
This project aimed to apply statistics method to investigate patterns of palindromes along Cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA sequence. The human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a potentially life-threatening disease for people with suppressed or deficient immune system. For example, CMV infection is typically unnoticed in healthy people, but can be life-threatening for the immunocompromised, such as HIV-infected persons, organ transplant recipients, or newborn infants. To develop strategies for combating the virus, scientists study the way in which the virus replicates: origin of replication.
